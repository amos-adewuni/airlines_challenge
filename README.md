# Maven Airlines Passenger Satisfaction Analysis
**Introduction**
This analysis aims to identify and address the factors contributing to the low satisfaction rate among Maven Airlines' passengers. The dataset, obtained from the Maven Airlines Challenge, contains customer satisfaction scores from over 120,000 airline passengers, along with additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel.

**Objectives**
Identify Reasons for Low Satisfaction Rate: Analyze the dataset to understand the key factors influencing passenger satisfaction negatively.
Recommend Data-Driven Strategies: Propose actionable strategies based on the analysis to improve Maven Airlines' overall satisfaction rate.

**Methodology**
Tool: Power BI was employed for the analysis. The dataset, already cleaned, underwent a thorough check in Power Query to ensure data quality. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used for computing essential measures like Satisfaction Rate, Total Passengers, Satisfied Passengers, Median Age, and Average Departure Delay (Minutes).

**Key Insights**
Low Satisfaction Among First-Time Passengers: The satisfaction rate for first-time passengers was notably low at 23.97%. This suggests a potential issue with the initial user experience or onboarding process.

Poor Satisfaction in Economy and Economy-Plus Classes: Economy and Economy-Plus passengers reported significantly low satisfaction rates of 18.77% and 24.64%, respectively. Improvements in these class offerings may positively impact overall satisfaction.

Age Group Disparities: Only the Adults age group exhibited a satisfaction rate above the mean of 43.45%. Special attention may be required for other age groups to enhance their experience.

**Recommendations**
Enhance Online Booking User Experience: Improve the user interface and experience of the online booking platform to ensure a smooth and user-friendly process, especially for first-time passengers.

Optimize Inflight WiFi Speed: Increase the speed and reliability of the inflight WiFi service to meet or exceed passenger expectations. A faster and more consistent connection can contribute to a positive overall experience.

Improve Leg Room for Seniors (>=65): Address the legroom concerns of senior passengers by providing better accommodations. This could involve reconfiguring seating arrangements or offering additional services to enhance comfort.

**Conclusion**
By addressing these key insights and implementing the recommended strategies, Maven Airlines has the opportunity to significantly improve its passenger satisfaction rates. Continual monitoring and adjustments based on customer feedback will be crucial for sustaining and enhancing overall customer experience.
